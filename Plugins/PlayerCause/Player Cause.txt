this plugin adds the ability to detect what player currently did what
for example

run the next command as who ever's health is above 18
run the next command as who ever's health is below 10
run the next command as who ever's health is above or equal 5
run the next command as who ever's health is 1
run the next command as who ever's armor is 0
run the next command as who ever's armor is above 0
run the next command as who ever's food is 0
run the next command as who ever's food is below 20
run the next command as who has just died
run the next command as who has just killed a person
run the next command as who has just killed someone
run the next command as who has just snuck

yep pretty much more coming later
