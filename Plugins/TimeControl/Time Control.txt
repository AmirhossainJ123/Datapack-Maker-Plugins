Probably the most important plugin between these all is the Time Control, its not about controlling the time like day or midnight or smth like that
its about having cooldowns and delays for example you want to run a command in 5 seconds later, or make a tnt explode every 5 seconds
or have 20 minutes timer or something like that, this is one of the most important plugins existing!

This plugin is still in development but you can still setup timers and stuff
